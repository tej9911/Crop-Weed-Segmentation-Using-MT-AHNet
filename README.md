# 🌱 Crop–Weed Segmentation Using MT-AHNet

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a deep learning-based solution for **crop and weed segmentation** using a **Multi-Task Attention-Augmented Hybrid Network (MT-AHNet)**. The system performs **pixel-level classification** to distinguish crops from weeds in agricultural fields, enabling precision farming and efficient weed management.
